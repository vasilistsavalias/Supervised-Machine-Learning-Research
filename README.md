 Comparative Analysis of Classification Techniques for Bankruptcy Prediction: A Machine Learning Approach
 
A critical component of risk management for creditors, investors, and legislators is identifying businesses that face bankruptcy. Timely interventions to mitigate potential losses and prevent systemic failures can be made possible by early detection of financial distress. With the ability to analyze financial data and make more accurate predictions about bankruptcy risk, machine learning has become a potent tool. To determine how well machine learning techniques can predict corporate bankruptcy, this study uses a wide range of techniques, such as Random Forests, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Logistic Regression (LDA), Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Cross-Validation. Based on the Bayes theorem, which divides data points into discrete categories according to their probability of belonging to each class, LDA and QDA are statistical classification techniques. QDA does not impose the assumption that the data points in each class follow a multivariate Gaussian distribution with a common covariance matrix, as does LDA. Data points are classified by KNN, a non-parametric classification algorithm, into the class most common among their closest neighbours. Although it is computationally efficient, the number of neighbours can have a significant impact. 

A strong classification algorithm called Support Vector Machines (SVM) finds a hyperplane that efficiently divides data points into different classes. Although it can be computationally demanding, it is especially effective when handling non-linear data. Multiple decision trees are combined in Random Forests, an ensemble learning technique, to increase classification accuracy. It is an adaptable algorithm that can manage intricate feature interactions. To assess how well machine learning models perform, a technique called cross-validation separates the data into training and testing sets. The training set is used to train the model, and the testing set is used to evaluate the model's performance and generalizability. Preprocessing the data, choosing features, training the model, and assessing performance are all part of the study's methodology. ROC curve analysis, precision score, and F1 score are used to assess how well the different machine learning techniques perform. The findings show that compared to the other techniques, Random Forests and QDA perform better at predicting corporate bankruptcy. These results demonstrate how machine learning can improve the accuracy of bankruptcy predictions and support financial industry stakeholders in making well-informed decisions.
